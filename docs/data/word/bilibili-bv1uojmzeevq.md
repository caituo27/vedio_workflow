How do you advise perennial overthinkers to get below the neck a little bit?
Perennial overthinkers get below the neck. ah
Record themselves all overthinking. Have a listen back. I do it. I overthink a lot. and when I've heard myself back, I'm like going, Dude, you're kind of seeing so much significance that none of that shit's significant.
Hmm. Every detailed frame have you're giving it a proper name. Oh, if everything's significant, there's no significance at all, man. Some shit's just like I don't have the capacity to deal with it or I don't really care. It's just how it is. Don't some of the inevitables and sometimes you got to let those ride. I'm I'm I'm not trying to this shit. It's just how it is. I'm going to deal with that now. I'm going to deal with what I can deal with. I I get the mental meditation on that.
And I listen to myself back and I'm like going, whoa, you need to get some sleep. You need to have a drink. You need to relax. You need to, you know, I got this uh uh funnyment here it's called barbiturate logic. Where's barbiturate logic? Can I find this for a second?
Uh, do do do do do do do do do do do There it is. I need to calm my brain to have half the thoughts per hour. 50% of the neural fragments and therefore twice the power. And one doubly meaningful story with half the words. You know, sometimes it just snaps. It's it's just it's too much. It's all trouble. and if everything is significant, like you you miss it the main thing. I I'm missing so focused on the drop. I didn't realize it was raining. It's the force for the tree thing.
So, that's the overthinking. When I've recorded myself, I can hear that there is some Lanyap, etc in my talk and some of it is Babel. Some of it may be succinctly fine-tuned and wonderful. Then I have to go, is that useful to my understanding? Is it useful to the story I can tell? Is it useful to my application in life? and a lot of times I'm like, no, it's clever, it's like smart shit. I don't want to spend too much time in that head because that sounds like, you know, you broke a sweat.
and in places you weren't really getting exercise, mentally, spiritually or physically. Um so that could sometimes listening, listening back has helped me baseline some things and going, slow the brain down, man. You're missing me, give more meaning. And you hear the smartest people, man, I love hearing the wiseest people, their stuff's short, bro. It's quick and you go, oh and you're like waiting for more and you're looking around and they're like, look that she like, oh that's it. And you're like, perfect.
My dad telling me when I wanted to go to film school instead of law school. and I thought he was going to go, you want to what? Him taking that pause and saying, is that what you want to do? And I said, yes sir, and him going, Well, don't half ass it. I was waiting for so much more and that was it. and there's no that was it. nothing better he could have told me at that time.
Yeah, it's also I think remembering when we overthink things or overexplain things. You're stealing a lot of times in in in moments that you think maybe you're teaching, even ourselves, especially others, you're stealing the the dignity of leaving the truth in the asker's kitchen. Like saying letting someone come up with have a conversation but you're letting them come up with the answer. It's like what the best directors do in films. They don't tell you what to do. They talk about and get you to go, oh, oh yeah, so to and they go,
It is as you say. Then we got ownership. Then that's our idea. Whether we were manipulated into it or not, we got going, thank you. It's mine. Now we got fire, now we got purpose. Now that you get the great performance in front of the camera and I think in in life more too. When a person feels like they came up with the idea. I always tell directors, I said, man, I'm easy to direct. just don't tell me what to do. And if you can, trick me into thinking all all of the shit to my idea. Yeah. You know.
Yeah. There's a wonderful insight about why we like people that's similar to that. So uh inverse charisma. Uh a lot of the time we think that we want to be more charismatic because that would make us more likable. We want our stories to be engaging and our aura to be electrifying and our presence to be magnetic and for us to walk into a room and for everybody to sort of look up, be compelled. And then I looked at the friends that I liked spending time around the most. And they're interesting, but that wasn't really the common denominator.
Some people are interesting and some people make you feel interesting. Mhm. And there's this wonderful story about Jenny Jerome, Winston Churchill's mother. and she gets to meet uh Benjamin Disraeli and William Gladstone on consecutive nights for dinner. And she leaves the first dinner, says, uh I left that feeling like he was the cleverest man in all of England. She goes to the second one. She says, I left that dinner feeling like I was the cleverest woman. And this wonderful idea that some people are interesting, some people make us feel interesting.
Mhm. And and kind of the same with with this idea here. that uh allowing allowing the conclusion to be arrived at. Yeah. Uh is often the best solution. Yeah. I I have to continually watch it. I love being in the know. I I love giving advice. I love sermonizing. My kids would be like, shh. I go to the Ted talk dad. like yeah, shut. They said sit down. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I got slides. the presentation. I'll let them find it and you know, I heard a cool trick and it was just so simple.
But uh one in talking and and sharing something that you've learned that you think maybe could be applicable to other people, the use of I, you or we to use the we, like you is dangerous because people go, you're talking at me, telling me what to do. I is safe because well, that's you that's your experience. Maybe you invite maybe people see themselves in it or not, but to say we, it's it's it's closer to platitudinal because you're going like, are you speaking for all of us? But it does welcome everybody in. and it says that, and I always like to say this when I'm talking about things with people, I'm like, when when I when I say we, I'm I'm including me. All right, because I'm not We includes me. Yeah, we includes me. I'm not I'm working on this shit too, man.
You know, um and try and like have to be reminded, don't don't be afraid to ask the question that I'm asking for myself that can open up someone else to go, well I got an answer to that. What do you got? Did with the similar with the kids last night. Instead of saying Peter, Levi, Livingston, how are you doing? Just tough answer, tough question answer. I said, and a friend gave me this note. I said, Hey, what's what's the life of a teenager like these days?
They took off and talked and shared all kinds of stuff. Cuz I wasn't putting them on the spot or they didn't take it as put on the spot. I found out so much more about how they're feeling by asking broad question. Broad question. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know.
